# MERN Project for the Vacas Movie Library

This project is for educational and practical purposes.

### Background Story for Project

My father is a big movie buff, and likes to collect movies, even if he hasn't seen them (some might call this a hoarder, but the guy has great taste). He developed a documentation system using Microsoft Word (yes, I know... he could've at least used Excel, but he preferred using it with that software), where only he has access to (Nope, not getting him into Google Docs or Dropbox) and is the only one that understands that system (\**Sigh*\* **v . v**); This is also reproduced for his book and CD collection.

As a first intention, this project is meant to recollect and render all his different movie collections (which is about over 1,000+ movies, from DVDs to Blu-rays), and make it available for others family members and friends to find movies within his system.
